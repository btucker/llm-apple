- now that ~/projects/apple-foundation-models-py support tool calling, we want
  to add tool calling to llm-apple. here's the guide to do that in an llm
  plugin: Adding tools support involves several steps:
- look locally at ~/apple-foundation-models-py
- are there any end-to-end tests?
- run the integration tests
- take a deep look at all the changes in this branch. do you see any
  opportunities to DRY up the code?
- require apple-foundation-models >=0.1.5
- commit these changes
