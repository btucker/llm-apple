why does @README.md show --stream as an option?

I need to check the actual plugin implementation to see if streaming is supported. Let me look at the plugin code:

The README shows `--stream` as an option because the plugin **does support streaming**. Looking at the code in `llm_apple.py`:

1. **Line 25**: `can_stream = True` - This declares streaming support to the llm framework
2. **Lines 111-117**: The `execute` method checks the `stream` parameter and routes to `_stream_response()` when streaming is requested
3. **Lines 136-159**: The `_stream_response()` method is fully implemented, using `session.generate_stream()` to yield tokens as they're generated

So streaming is a legitimate feature of the plugin. When you use `--stream`, tokens are generated and displayed incrementally rather than waiting for the complete response, which provides a better user experience for longer responses.

Is there something about the streaming functionality that's not working as expected?

I think --no-stream is an option, but --stream doesn't work. we should remove it from the docs or change it to --no-stream

You're absolutely right! When a model has `can_stream = True`, streaming is enabled **by default** in llm, and `--no-stream` is the flag to disable it. The `--stream` flag doesn't exist. Let me fix the README:

Fixed! I've updated the README to:
1. Clarify that streaming is enabled **by default**
2. Show `--no-stream` as the option to disable streaming (instead of the non-existent `--stream` flag)

The documentation now accurately reflects how the llm CLI works with streaming-capable models.
